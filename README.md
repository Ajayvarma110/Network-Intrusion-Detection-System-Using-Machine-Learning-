Network Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

Overview This repository contains a machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The system is designed to analyze network traffic and classify it into normal traffic or potential intrusions using various machine learning algorithms.

Repository Structure

data/: Directory for storing dataset files.
models/: Directory for saving trained machine learning models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for reproducing the environment.
Getting Started To get started with the NIDS, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/22KarthikV/Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning.git
cd Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Explore the notebooks:

Use Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to explore the dataset, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
Run scripts:

Scripts in src/ can be used for automated preprocessing, training models, and evaluating results. Modify these scripts as needed for your specific use case.
Train and evaluate models:

Train different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) using provided scripts or notebooks.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deploying the NIDS:

Modify and integrate the trained model into your network infrastructure for real-time or batch intrusion detection.
Dataset The dataset used in this project is stored in the data/ directory. It includes network traffic data with labeled instances of normal activities and various types of intrusions. Please refer to the dataset documentation for detailed information on its structure and attributes.

Contributing Contributions to improve the Network Intrusion Detection System or add new features/models are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
